## 🚀 About This Project

I built this project to be more than just a standard list of links. The "Coder's Workbench" is a fully interactive, single-page application that serves as my digital portfolio. The concept was to create a tangible and memorable experience for visitors, allowing them to explore my projects and skills in a unique way.

The entire experience, including the refined parallax effect, interactive lamp, and live-typing animations, is built with **100% vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** to showcase a deep understanding of core web technologies without relying on frameworks.

## 🔥 Features at a Glance

* **🪐 Interactive Parallax Desk:** All items on the desk subtly float and shift based on mouse movement for a realistic 3D effect.
* **💡 Ambient Lighting Toggle:** Click the desk lamp to switch between a focused warm light and a cool ambient mood.
* **✍️ Live-Typing Animations:** Watch my bio and skills get typed out in real-time on the laptop.
* **📂 Detailed Project Modals:** Click on key projects to open a detailed modal with descriptions and links to the live demos.
* **🤫 Developer "Easter Egg":** A special message for fellow developers who open the browser console.
* **🔗 Fully Linked:** Seamlessly navigate to my other projects, my resume, and my social profiles.
