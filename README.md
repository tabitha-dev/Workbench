(Pro Tip: Replace this with a screen recording (GIF) of you interacting with the desk items, especially the parallax effect and the lamp. This is a huge "wow" factor for recruiters! You can use a tool like Giphy Capture or Kap.)

🚀 About The Project
This project was built to be more than just a standard list of links. It's a fully interactive, single-page application that serves as a digital portfolio. The "Coder's Workbench" concept creates a tangible and memorable experience for visitors, allowing them to explore projects and skills in a unique way.

The entire experience, including the refined parallax effect, interactive lamp, and live-typing animations, is built with 100% vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to showcase a deep understanding of core web technologies without relying on frameworks.

🌟 Key Features
Interactive Parallax Desk: Items on the desk subtly shift and float based on mouse movement, creating a beautiful 3D effect.

"Live" Components: The laptop screen and notebook feature dynamic "live-typing" animations to draw the user's attention to key information.

Ambiance Toggle: A clickable desk lamp that changes the lighting and mood of the entire scene.

Project Showcase: Key projects are presented as physical items on the desk, opening detailed modals with descriptions and links to live demos.

Developer "Easter Egg": A custom, styled message for fellow developers who open the browser console.
