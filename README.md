A creative portfolio designed as a developer's digital workbench, built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

(Pro Tip: Replace this with a screen recording (GIF) of you interacting with the desk items. This is a huge "wow" factor! You can use a tool like Giphy Capture or Kap.)

🚀 About This Project
I built this project to be more than just a standard list of links. The "Coder's Workbench" is a fully interactive, single-page application that serves as my digital portfolio. The concept was to create a tangible and memorable experience for visitors, allowing them to explore my projects and skills in a unique way.

The entire experience, including the refined parallax effect, interactive lamp, and live-typing animations, is built with 100% vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to showcase a deep understanding of core web technologies without relying on frameworks.

🌟 Key Features
Interactive Parallax Desk: Items on the desk subtly float based on mouse movement, creating a beautiful 3D effect.

"Live" Components: The laptop and notebook feature dynamic "live-typing" animations to draw the user's attention to key information.

Ambiance Toggle: A clickable desk lamp that changes the lighting and mood of the entire scene.

Developer "Easter Egg": A custom, styled message for fellow developers who open the browser console.
